# SmartCollector 🚛♻️

SmartCollector is a C-based project that simulates an intelligent waste collection system using data structures like graphs and heaps.  
It models cities, bins, and truck routes to efficiently manage waste collection using shortest path logic and dynamic priority queues.

## Features
- Dynamic graph structure for city mapping
- Smart bin tracking with dynamic fill levels
- Min-heap based truck scheduling
- Modular C design (graph.c, truck.c, main.c)
- Extensible and portable on Linux systems

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** C  
- **Data Structures:** Graphs, Min-Heaps, Queues  
- **Platform:** Linux (GCC compatible)  

## How to Run
1. Compile using:
   ```bash
   gcc main.c graph.c truck.c -o SmartCollector
   ./SmartCollector
   ```
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to add locations, bins, and trucks.
